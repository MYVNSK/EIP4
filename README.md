Definitions:

1. Convolutions: Convolution is extracting information from images
2. Filters/Kernels: filters extract the features of image.
3. Epoch: one iteration of training over entire data set
4. 1x1 convolution: 1x1 convolutions passes the input pixel entirely to the output. It doesn't consider the influence of adjacent pixels.
5. 3x3 convolution: 3x3 convolution uses a 3x3 matrix to process the input pixels to the output. 
6. Feature Maps: Feature Maps are output from convoultion. they are generated by the fitlers/kernel. 
7. Actication Function: Based on activation functions's result, the input is converted/passed to the output. 
8. Receptive Field: the set of pixesls being operated by convolutions filter/kernel.
